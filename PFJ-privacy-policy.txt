Privacy Policy
    Effective Date: June 19th 2025
    Last Updated: June 19th 2025
Thank you for playing our game. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

1. What We Collect
We may collect:
    Device info (like phone model and OS version)

    Ad-related data (like if you saw or clicked an ad)

We do not collect analytics or track personal activity in the game.

2. Ads and Personalization
We show ads using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).
Personalized ads are only shown to users who are over the legal age in their region and have given consent.

Non-personalized ads are shown to younger users or those who don’t give consent.

We follow all privacy laws like GDPR (Europe), COPPA (USA), and others.

3. Third-Party Services
We use:
Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob)
See their privacy policy here: https://policies.google.com/privacy


We don’t use any other SDKs right now, but may add ad mediation partners later.

4. Consent and Your Choices
GDPR: You’ll see a consent pop-up when you open the game in supported regions.

CCPA: You can change your consent in the game’s settings.

COPPA: Kids under 13 only get non-personalized ads.

iOS (ATT): Apple will ask if you allow tracking.


5. Data Sharing
We do not sell your data. Some data is shared with Google Ads to show ads, as required by law.

6. Kids’ Privacy
We don’t collect personal info from kids. Non-personalized ads are shown to children automatically.

7. Security
We use basic protections to keep your data safe. But no system is 100% secure.

8. Your Rights
You may have the right to:

    Ask us to delete your data

    Change or withdraw consent

    Opt-out of ad personalization


To do this, contact us at the email below.

9. Where the Game is Available
Our game is available globally wherever Apple distributes apps, except for regions like China where it’s not supported.

10. Links
The game only links to this privacy policy. No other websites or social media are included.

11. Changes to This Policy
If we update this policy, we’ll post the new version here and in the game if needed.
